random thoughts:
- say we have a finisher flavor (aka only 1 player adds an ingredient.) do we immediately process?
- do we actually check if we are making progress toward the goal during each placement instead?
- this logic may break if we have spectators! make some sort of array of player IDs I think, maybe. Like, baker IDs
